I want to recreate the boss fight in the fourth castle from the original Zelda on NES. It will be Relda, the legend of Nitsud. Most of the background and other elements should be created with canvas. I'm going to need to track a health bar, move the mc sprite, animate a the boss sprite that will target the mc with projectiles that can reduce player health. Player should have the ablilty move around on the screen within a designated grid that may have obsticles that can interact with the hit boxes of the projectiles. 


Bonus, I'm starting with the Boss fight that is the most insteresting part of the castle, but I love that I can keep building this out. If time permits I can add additional rooms, including locked rooms that require keys, switch puzzles that only open doors if the elements are interacted with in the correct way. additional enemies.

__*In "Relda: the legend of Nitsud", users will be able to:*__

1.   Traverse the room in pre-defined squares
2.   keep track of health with a heart counter in the top right of the screen
3.   attack enemies with a sword
4.   defend against enemy attacks with a shield
   
*__In addition, this project will include:__*

1.    instructions for how to win
2.    intuitive move and attack options relying on keyboard input
3.    canvas background and other elements
4.    ui that includes valuable information like key: action map in a styalized fashion
5.    classic 8 bit chip music, and audio that plays when certain actions take place.

*Check out the wireframe for a high level view of how I plan on laying out the elements*

Timeline

__Friday__: get a canvas background to render correctly to the screen. Find most of if not all of the assets that I'm going to be using. Class for moving object, that is going to be inherited by most of the interesting elements in the game.

__Monday__: I'm going to have the main boss animated and be able to move the mc around on the screen, as well as have audio and collision finnished.

__Tuesday__: Base of the game finished so that I can work on setting up the start game and ending game screens. Fluent game set up and restart.

__Wednesday__: I'm working on some of my bonuses this day. Additional weapon for the mc, two or three enemies and two or three more screens that must be traversed before reaching the boss.

__Thursday__: This day is devoted to publishing the work, making sure that everything works correctly on the hosted site.

Credit is given where credit is do. I couldn't have made my game without the contributions from these generous people.
