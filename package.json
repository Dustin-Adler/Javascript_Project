It will be Relda, the legend of Nitsud. lol. most of the background and other elements should be created with canvas. I'm going to need to track a health bar, move the mc sprite, animate a the boss sprite that will target the mc with projectiles that can reduce player health. Player should have the ablilty move around on the screen within a designated grid that may have obsticles that can interact with the hit boxes of the projectiles.",
